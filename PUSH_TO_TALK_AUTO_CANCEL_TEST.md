# Push-to-Talk Auto-Cancel Feature Test

## What was implemented

Added a 200ms minimum hold duration check for the push-to-talk hotkey to prevent the overlay from getting stuck when the key is pressed and released too quickly.

## How it works

1. When the push-to-talk hotkey is pressed (`handleKeyDown`):
   - Recording starts immediately
   - A 200ms timer is started to check minimum hold duration
   - If the key is released before 200ms, the recording is automatically cancelled
   - If the key is still held after 200ms, recording continues normally

2. When the push-to-talk hotkey is released (`handleKeyUp`):
   - Checks if the hold duration was less than 200ms
   - If yes: calls `_ensureRecordingCleanup()` to cancel recording and hide overlay
   - If no: proceeds with normal transcription flow

3. The `_ensureRecordingCleanup()` method:
   - Cancels any ongoing recording
   - Resets all state variables
   - Unregisters Esc key
   - Hides the overlay
   - Shows a toast message indicating the cancellation

## Testing scenarios

### Test 1: Quick press/release (< 200ms)
1. Press and quickly release the push-to-talk hotkey (Alt+Space)
2. Expected: Recording should start but immediately cancel
3. Expected: Toast message: "Push-to-talk cancelled (released too quickly)"
4. Expected: Overlay should disappear
5. Expected: Debug log: "Push-to-talk key was released too quickly, auto-cancelling"

### Test 2: Normal hold (> 200ms)
1. Press and hold the push-to-talk hotkey for more than 200ms
2. Expected: Debug log: "Push-to-talk minimum hold duration met, continuing recording"
3. Release the key
4. Expected: Normal transcription flow

### Test 3: Escape cancellation still works
1. Press and hold the push-to-talk hotkey
2. While holding, press Escape
3. Expected: Recording cancels via normal Esc mechanism
4. Expected: Timer is properly cleaned up

## Code changes made

1. Added `dart:async` import for Timer
2. Added `static Timer? _minimumHoldTimer;` variable
3. Modified `handleKeyDown()` to start 200ms timer
4. Modified `handleKeyUp()` to check hold duration and cancel timer
5. Modified `cancelRecording()` to clean up timer
6. Added `_ensureRecordingCleanup()` method for quick release handling
7. Added timer cleanup in error handling

## Files modified

- `lib/features/hotkeys/handlers/push_to_talk_handler.dart`

The implementation ensures that:
- No overlay gets stuck when quick-pressing the hotkey
- Proper cleanup of all resources (timers, recording state, Esc key registration)
- Normal recording functionality is preserved for longer holds
- All existing cancellation mechanisms (Esc key, close button) continue to work
